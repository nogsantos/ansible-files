bootstrap
=========

Prepare your system to be managed by Ansible.

Example Playbook
----------------

This example is taken from `molecule/default/playbook.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: false
  become: true

  roles:
    - robertdebock.bootstrap

  tasks:
    - name: test connection
      ping:

```

Also see a [full explanation and example](https://robertdebock.nl/how-to-use-these-roles.html) on how to use these roles.

Role Variables
--------------

These variables are set in `defaults/main.yml`:
```yaml
---
# defaults file for bootstrap

# The user to use to connect to machines.
bootstrap_user: root

# Installed software to support modules flagged as "preview" (i.e. mysql_db).
# "yes", "no" or unset are valid.
bootstrap_preview: yes

# Do you want to wait for the host to be available?
bootstrap_wait_for_host: no

# The number of seconds you want to wait during connection test before failing.
bootstrap_timeout: 3

# The number of retries you want tasks to do before failing.
bootstrap_retries: 3

# To update all packages installed by this roles, set `bootstrap_package_state` to `latest`.
bootstrap_package_state: present

```
